       <h2>The Ocean</h2>
       <h3>by Nathaniel Hawthorne</h3>
       <p><pre>
        The Ocean has its silent caves,

        Deep, quiet, and alone;

        Though there be fury on the waves,

        Beneath them there is none.

        The awful spirits of the deep

        Hold their communion there;

        And there are those for whom we weep,

        The young, the bright, the fair.

        Calmly the wearied seamen rest

        Beneath their own blue sea.

        The ocean solitudes are blest,

        For there is purity.

        The earth has guilt, the earth has care,

        Unquiet are its graves;

        But peaceful sleep is ever there,

        Beneath the dark blue waves.
